Diacritics in Arabic language are the signs that are found
above or under Arabic letters. Their main aim is to provide phonetic
aid to readers as well as allowing them to understand the Arabic text
in its intended and correct context. The existence of a diacritical mark
can entirely change the meaning of Arabic text. Existing Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) systems face accuracy difficulties when trying
to read Arabic letters with diacritics. This affects the quality of the digitized
Arabic text. 

*tashkeelWAP* is a web application with
two games that allow the digitization of Arabic text by outsourcing it
to native Arabic speaking players. As a bi-product of playing the games,
we collect possible digitization of Arabic words with diacritics that were
not recognized by OCR systems.


The project was implemented as part of my bachelor thesis project. It resulted in a [paper](http://met.guc.edu.eg/Repository/Faculty/Publications/627/tashkeelWAP.pdf) presented during the 2nd International Conference on Arabic Computational Linguistics (ACLing 2016), 2016.
